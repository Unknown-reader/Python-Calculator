# Python-Calculator
My GUI calculator which made with Python and Tkinter

It's my first project, I don't really sure that everything is made in an approprite way.

Calculator has basic mathematical operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division), very user-friendly(my personal opinion:â‚½)
exponentiation, work with percents and square root.
